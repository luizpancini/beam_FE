# beam_FE
The current version contains a displacement finite element program that supports linear static analysis of three-dimensional beam frames (LS3DB) and linear natural vibration of three-dimensional beam frames (LNV3DB). Given a set of loads on a parametrized beam frame, the LS3DB program outputs the deformed structure, the generalized displacements and internal loads, as shown below:

The LNV3DB supports the calculation of mode shapes and natural frequencies of beam frames with a variety of boundary conditions, including springs and inertias. Several test example scripts are included, demonstrating the program capabilities, as shown:
